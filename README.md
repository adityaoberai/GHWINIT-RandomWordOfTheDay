## üìù Environment Variables

Go to Settings tab of your Cloud Function and add the following environment variables:

- `TwilioAccountSID`: Twilio Account SID
- `TwilioAuthToken`: Twilio Auth Token
- `TwilioPhoneNumber`: Twilio Phone Number to send the SMS from
- `ToPhoneNumber`: Phone Number to send the SMS to

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è _The Twilio Account SID and Auth Token can be obtained from your Twilio console. You can purchase a Twilio phone number using [this guide](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223135247-How-to-Search-for-and-Buy-a-Twilio-Phone-Number-from-Console)._

## üöÄ Deployment

There are two ways of deploying the Appwrite function, both having the same results, but each using a different process. We highly recommend using CLI deployment to achieve the best experience.

### Using CLI

Make sure you have [Appwrite CLI](https://appwrite.io/docs/command-line#installation) installed, and you have successfully logged into your Appwrite server. To make sure Appwrite CLI is ready, you can use the command `appwrite client --debug` and it should respond with green text `‚úì Success`.

Make sure you are in the same folder as your `appwrite.json` file and run `appwrite deploy function` to deploy your function. You will be prompted to select which functions you want to deploy.

### Manual using tar.gz

Manual deployment has no requirements and uses Appwrite Console to deploy the tag. First, enter the folder of your function. Then, create a tarball of the whole folder and gzip it. After creating `.tar.gz` file, visit Appwrite Console, click on the `Deploy Tag` button and switch to the `Manual` tab. There, set the `entrypoint` to `src/Index.cs`, and upload the file we just generated.
